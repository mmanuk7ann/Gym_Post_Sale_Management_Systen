The problem area lies in **Customer Retention** and **Customer Lifetime Value optimization** in the fitness industry.

Many gyms lack proactive systems to detect disengaged members and intervene before they churn.  
Extended periods of absence not only signal a higher risk of churn but can also lead to **customer demotivation**, decreased engagement, and weakened **brand loyalty**.
